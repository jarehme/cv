    <h1>Jeremy Yuan</h1>
    <p><em>Studying Full-Stack Web Development</em></p>
     
    <p> When I was a child, my father was a software developer for various companies including multiple entrepeneurial self-ventures. All of which were
        extremely successful. He started a jewerly business built from scratch by himself all the way to developing sports radio applications for the Apple App Store.
        Being exposed to this at such a young age has fueled a deep passion. Because of this passion, I am learning skills involving Full-Stack Web Development. 
        This includes but is not limited to gaining expertise in, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, Web3, APIs and Cryptocurrency.
        Driven by love for an innovative future, the tools and knowledge I am gaining here are a valuable asset in my professional & development.</p>
